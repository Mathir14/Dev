The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Example 3:
Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.

fibonacci number â€” classic problem
base cases: return n if n is 0 or 1

then just loop from 2 to n, keeping track of last two fib numbers
use a third variable `temp` to hold the new value

`f1` and `f2` shift forward each time
iterative is faster and no stack overflow like recursion
