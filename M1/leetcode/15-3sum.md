another two pointer problem
this problem involves convering pointers

we are given an array,
we are required to return, the triplet of index which when summed, is equal to 0, we have to do this and return, every unique triplet which when summed corresponds to 0

to make things easier, we sort the array
make an empty list to store the triplets,

now for 3 sum, we need three pointers, or more like, 1 stay pointer and 2 free pointer, whatever you want to call it,

first, the general method of solving this is,
we got three pointers, we fix one at the start, and then perform 2sum on the remaining 1:n-1 array, with left at fixed+1 and right at len of array -1

the fixed is managed by the for loop, with range of len of array -2
because we have two more pointers left at fixed+1 and right at the end of the array

we have an edgecase,
where if value of fixed > 0 then we break the loop and return the answer
because, since the array is sorted, if value of fixed is greater than 0 that means no element can be added to make it reduced to 0 that means, no triplet can be summed to return 0, 

this edgecase is used for early exits and avoid pointless comparisons when no solution exists after that,

the main problem is avoiding duplicates since we cannot use the same element in a triplet,

to avoid this, we need to make sure duplicate values are skipped,

first we need to skip duplicate values in fixed,
we can do this by checking if value of current fixed is equal to value of previous fixed which means it is a duplicate value since the array is sorted, and so we use continue to skip to the next iteration,

we have two free pointers left and right,
left at fixed + 1 and right at len of array -1
now this problem is basically boiled down to 2sum,

with while left < right since we dont want to use the same element twice,
now we check if the sum of values of indexes fixed left and right is equal to 0, if it is, we append that value to the answer array

and we move both left and right inward,
now, we need to make sure, the left and right pointers dont pick up duplicate elements, 

to skip duplicates, we check using the same logic again,
whether value of left is equal to value of left -1
and same for right, 
if they are duplicates, then we move them inward and check this in a while loop so that the loop closes when a non duplicate element is found or the array is exhausted

with duplicates handled, we check, if total is greater than 0 which means, the sum of the value of indexes fixed left and right is greater than 0,
since right is the bigger element, we move it inward to check with smaller value of right,

same with left, if the total is lesser than 0 then that means, the value of left is lower than what needs to be,
and so we move left inward to check with bigger values of left

this process iterates, for every fixed element until the condition left < right is achieved, then the next fixed element is taken and the pointers are reset, 

when the main fixed loop is over, we return the answer array which holds the all possible combination of unique triplets whose sum corrspond to 0
