Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

    Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

    A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
    Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

 

Example 1:

Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

create an empty set called seen

iterate over all rows (0 to 8)

iterate over all columns (0 to 8)

get the value at board[r][c]

if value is '.', skip it

create three keys:

("row", r, val) for the row

("col", c, val) for the column

("box", r//3, c//3, val) for the 3x3 sub-box

if any of these keys already exist in seen, return false

otherwise, add all three keys to seen

after checking all cells, return true

basically, this tracks each valueâ€™s presence in its row, column, and box using a set to quickly detect duplicates
