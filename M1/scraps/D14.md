# Day 14 – Miscellaneous (if **name** == "**main**", venv, Code Structure, pip)

### 1. `if __name__ == "__main__"`

- Acts as a gatekeeper: code under this block runs only if the file is executed directly.
- If the file is imported, `__name__` equals the filename, so the block doesn’t execute.
- Example:

  ```python
  def greet():
      print("Hello!")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      greet()
  ```

2. Virtual Environment (venv)
   A sandbox for project dependencies — keeps each project isolated.

Commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
deactivate 3. Clean & Modular Code Structure
Break logic into functions and modules.

Use descriptive names, no unnecessary global variables.

Keep test/demo code under if **name** == "**main**" so imports remain clean.

4. pip and requirements.txt
   pip install <package> to install libraries.

pip freeze > requirements.txt saves all dependencies.

pip install -r requirements.txt recreates environment for others.
