# Dev

Just a repo to keep track of my coding progress.

### Why it exists:
- To stay consistent
- To have everything I work on in one place
- To see how much better I get over time

### Whatâ€™s inside:
- Python practice (roadmap-based)
- DSA problems (mostly LeetCode)
- Small personal projects and ideas

### Other profiles:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/Mathir14/)
- [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/mathir-vishnu-m-217623289/)

Nothing fancy. Just me trying to improve, one commit at a time.
